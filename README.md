# Firebase Chat

This project drew inspiration from Fireship's tutorial [https://fireship.io/lessons/react-firebase-chat-app-tutorial/](here). Instead of having a global chat, I used firebase to implement a full 1 on 1 chat with users who are globally registered on the platform.

## Getting Started
1. You will need to setup the node modules so go ahead and use your favourite package manager:
```sh
$ yarn
```
2. Now, simply start the react app:
```sh
$ yarn start
```

## Tools Used

- React
- Firebase
- React Toastify
- React Firebase Hooks
- React Bootstrap / Bootstrap

## TODO
- Moving forward there will be options to block, and only message people that you are friends with.
- Read Notifications
- Typing indicators
